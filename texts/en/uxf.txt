My next stop was at a group of sports enthusiasts at UX Fans.

A few of my former colleagues worked there and I was able to use my freshly 
recharged knowledge of React.
As soon as this opportunity arose, I jumped at it and very quickly integrated 
myself into the team.

My work included developing websites and web applications for well-known companies and startups.
For example, I participated in the development of an internal system for Atrea, 
a company catalog for My House Step by Step, creating a calculator for calculating 
savings when installing photovoltaics, searching for hotels for Orea and developing components 
for Rehatab or Předplátko.
In the meantime, I developed an internal UI kit with my colleagues.

The development here was carried out in an agile manner and every week I met with 
other developers for regular sessions, where we discussed and shared our experiences.

The tech stack included React, Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, GraphQL.

After some time, I decided to look for new challenges and opportunities 
for further professional growth.
