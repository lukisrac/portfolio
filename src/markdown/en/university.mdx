After high school, I wanted to try my luck and
applied to medicine university.
\
\
I didn't get into either of them, so I switched to plan B,
that is, studying General Nursing at the Technical University of Liberec.
\
\
At that time, however, the thought started to cross my mind
whether healthcare is what I want to do in life.
\
\
So why don't I help the sick instead of writing code?
Such a profession needs to be done with the heart, which I simply didn't have.
\
\
I've been drawn to computers since I was a child, so I knew
that my path would lead towards IT.
\
\
So, after six months at university, life changed...
