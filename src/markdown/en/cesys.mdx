My first work experience in IT was as a Coder
for the Liberec company CeSYS
which provides a system for travel agencies.
\
\
That's where I first got a glimpse of web development and
I knew I wanted to continue doing it.
\
\
CeSYS stands for tour search engine and also
a robust content management system.
\
\
It offers travel agencies an easily editable website with a unique design.
\
\
At the same time, there is an administration
for managing the website and tour requests.
\
\
My job here was coding, i.e.
transferring graphic design to a functional website.
\
\
I also played the role of technical support for CeSYS clients.
\
\
I learned the basics of the holy trinity of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The jQuery library was widely used to speed up development.
\
\
After almost 3 years of cooperation, I felt the need to move on...
